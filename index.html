        <h2>Javascript</h2>

        <ul>

          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
          <li>An operator is a mathematical symbol that produces a result based on two values (or variables).</li>
          <li>Conditionals are code structures used to test if an expression returns true or not. A very common form of conditionals is the if...else statement. </li>
          <li>Functions are a way of packaging functionality that you wish to reuse. It's possible to define a body of code as a function that executes when you call the function name in your code.</li>
          <li>The semicolon in JavaScript is used to separate statements, but it can be omitted if the statement is followed by a line break (or there’s only one statement in a {block}). A statement is a piece of code that tells the computer to do something.</li>
          <li>Math.floor() and Math.random() are both properties of JavaScript's built-in Math object that can be used together to generate a random number.</li>
          <li>The Boolean type represents a logical entity and is inhabited by two values: true and false.</li>
          <li>Boolean values are usually used for conditional operations, including ternary operators, if...else, while, etc.</li>
